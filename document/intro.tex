The IObundle KNN core includes a configurable hardware accelerator for the KNN
machine learning algorithm. It is written in Verilog and includes a C software
driver. The user may change the size of the module to fit in its own FPGAs
balancing the compromise between desired performance and space available. The IP
is currently supported for use in FPGAs.
