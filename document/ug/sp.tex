In this section are explained the synthesis parameters that can be changed in
order to generate a bigger or smaller module to better fit the user needs.

\textbf{N\_Neighbour} is the parameter that defines the number of neighbour points for each of the KNN Cores that are going to be ordered by their distance to the main point.

\textbf{NT\_points} defines the number of KNN Cores available in the hardware.
